## How to Use

1. I compiled the python script using <a href="https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller">pyinstaller</a> and converted it into a standalone windows executable(.exe). It is included in the [repo's release](https://github.com/Eshaan7/RenameThemSubs/releases/).

2. This is now also available as a web application. https://RenameThemSubs.herokuapp.com/ **(Recommended)**

3. git clone this repo and directly run `python3 renamethemsubs.py` **(Recommended)**

## What the script does
You download a TV show from torrent and find the suitable subtitle files from some website.
Renaming every subtitle file to match the video file is a pain in the ass, isn't it?
That's where this app comes in handy.

## Motivation behind such a silly project
A few years back I would often have to manually rename all subtitle files to match episode name and I always wondered why isn't there a
software that does it for you ? Well, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzWNBmjyv7Y">fine, I'll do it myself.</a>
